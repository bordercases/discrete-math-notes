## Original Description

Notes and solutions for discrete math course (SFWR 2DM3). Based on "A logical approach to discrete math" by David Gries and Fred B. Schneider.

Disclaimer: these are only the solutions to the exercises. It is strongly encouraged to try them yourselves before looking at the answer. NO answers to assignments or anything graded is provided, so no academic dishonesty policies are being violated.

Answers to exercises are in file labelled "exercises"
A complete list of theorems are in the file labelled "theorems"
